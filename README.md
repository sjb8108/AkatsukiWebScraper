# AkatsukiWebScraper

-This project took me over a month and half and I had a blast with it and would say its the favorite thing I've created so far
-This is a Web Scraper that visited over 200,000 websites, over 100,000 of which I was able to collect data from
-Akatsuki is a private server connected to the game Osu! So all data collected relates to the game. 
    If you do not know of Osu I would recommend watching this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgJd1zV9NMQ
-If you would like to see all the data just open the data folder and click any file.
    Note that the data is serizaled using the pickle library so it will be hard to understand
-When running the program follow the directions printed and you will get a good explaination of what everything does!
-I would like to keep updating this project to add more ways to manipulate the data and make the web scraper cleaner
